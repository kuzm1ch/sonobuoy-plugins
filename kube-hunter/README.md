# Kube-hunter

[kube-hunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter) is a security app created by Aqua Security in order to increase awareness and visibility for security issues in Kubernetes environments.

# Getting started

To run this plugin with the default options, run the following command:

```
sonobuoy run --plugin https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy-plugins/master/kube-hunter/kube-hunter-plugin.yaml --wait
```

The plugin creates a JSON document which lists all the known issues. This can be found in the resulting Sonobuoy tarball.

To download the tarball, run:

```
outfile=$(sonobuoy retrieve)
```

The tarball can be manually inspected or you can use the command below to dump the JSON data generated by the plugin:

```
sonobuoy results $outfile --plugin kube-hunter --mode=detailed --skip-prefix
```

# Images

## Our image

The plugin definition provided here (kube-hunter-plugin.yaml) utilizes a manually built Docker image from the kube-hunter source. Using this image is the default.

## Upstream image

Alternatively, Aqua Security provides a pre-built image (`aquasec/kube-hunter`) which includes additional code (closed source) for uploading results into a report that can be viewed via their site.

See the [README](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter#container) for more details.

If you'd like to use this image, just change the name of the image in `kube-hunter-plugin.yaml`

## Your own image

Lastly, similar to the `sonobuoy/kube-hunter` image, you can manually build your own image from the upstream kube-hunter code.

If you'd like to use your own image you'll need to:

 - clone their repo
 - use `docker build` to build your own image
 - push the image to a registry
 - update the `kube-hunter-plugin.yaml` to reference your image
